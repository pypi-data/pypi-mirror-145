# Download and load spaCy models on-the-fly

A tiny drop-in replacement for `spacy.load()` that automatically downloads a model when it is not currently installed.

Usage is identical to [`spacy.load()`](https://spacy.io/api/top-level/#spacy.load), meaning that you can also exclude
or disable pipeline components. Example:

```python
from spacy_download import load_spacy

nlp = load_spacy("en_core_web_sm", exclude=["parser", "tagger"])  # Will download the model if it isn't installed yet
```

Under the hood, the package makes use of spaCy's capability to import models as modules, rather than using spaCy's
built-in loader. This allows us to first download a model with `pip` and then load it as a module.

**Note**: if you are using transformer models, you still need to install `spacy-transformers` yourself!
