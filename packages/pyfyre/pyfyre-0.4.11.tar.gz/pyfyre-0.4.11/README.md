PyFyre is a web frontend framework for building reactive static user interfaces on the web using Python.
- [x] Component-based framework. Developers who have experience of using other frontend frameworks should feel quite at home when using PyFyre, especially Flutter developers.
- [ ] Supports JavaScript interoperability, allowing developers to leverage NPM packages and integrate with existing JavaScript applications (working on)
- [ ] Supports CPython interoperability, allowing developers to use existing PyPi packages on the client-side web (planning stage)

PyFyre is at the top of Brython (Browser Python), a Python 3 implementation for client-side web programming.

**Note: PyFyre is not 1.0 yet. Be prepared to do major refactoring due to breaking API changes.**

## Documentation
The documentation can be found in PyFyre website:
https://pyfyre.netlify.app/

## Examples
We have examples in the [examples](examples) folder. But here is the super simple example.
See how easy it is to create a simple Hello World web app that shows Hello, World text:

```py
from pyfyre.widgets import *
from pyfyre.pyfyre import runApp

class MyWebpage(UsesState):
    def build(self):
        return Container(
            children=[
                Text("Hello, World!")
            ]
        )

runApp(MyWebpage())
```
