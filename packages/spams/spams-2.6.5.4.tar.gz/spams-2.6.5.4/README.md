# SPAMS: a SPArse Modeling Software

Here is the Python package interfacing the SPAMS C++ library.

## What is SPAMS?

SPAMS (SPArse Modeling Software) is an optimization toolbox for solving various sparse estimation problems.

- Dictionary learning and matrix factorization (NMF, sparse PCA, ...)
- Solving sparse decomposition problems with LARS, coordinate descent, OMP, SOMP, proximal methods
- Solving structured sparse decomposition problems (l1/l2, l1/linf, sparse group lasso, tree-structured regularization, structured sparsity with overlapping groups, ...)


## Installation

### Requirements

- a C++ modern compiler (tested with gcc >= 4.5)
- a BLAS/LAPACK library (like OpenBLAS, Intel MKL, Atlas)

Carefully install **libblas & liblapack**. For example, on Ubuntu, it is necessary to do `sudo apt-get -y install libblas-dev liblapack-dev gfortran`. For MacOS, you most likely need to do `brew install gcc openblas lapack`.

For better performance, we recommend to install the **MKL Intel library** (available for instance on PyPI with `pip install mkl`, or in the Anaconda Python distribution with `conda install mkl`) before installing Numpy (which is a dependency of SPAMS, the latter checking Numpy configuration for its installation).

SPAMS for Python was tested on **Linux** and **MacOS**. It is **not available for Windows** at the moment. **For MacOS users**, the install setup detects if OpenMP is available on your system and enable/disable OpenMP support accordingly. For better performance, we recommend to install an **OpenMP-compatible compiler** on your system (e.g. `gcc` or `llvm`).

**Note for Windows users:** at the moment you can run `pip install spams-bin` (provided by <https://github.com/samuelstjean/spams-python>).

### Installation from PyPI:

The standard installation uses the BLAS and LAPACK libraries used by Numpy:
```bash
pip install spams
```

### Installation from sources

Make sure you have install libblas & liblapack (see above)
```bash
git clone https://github.com/getspams/spams-python
cd spams-python
pip install -e .
```

### Usage

Manipulated objects are imported from numpy and scipy. Matrices should be stored by columns, and sparse matrices should be "column compressed".


### Testing the interface

- From the command line (to be called from the project root directory):
```bash
python tests/test_spams.py -h       # print the man page
python tests/test_spams.py          # run all the tests
```

- From Python (assuming `spams` package is installed):
```python
from spams.tests import test_spams

test_spams('-h')                    # print the man page
test_spams()                        # run all tests
test_spams(['sort', 'calcAAt'])     # run specific tests
test_spams(python_exec='python3')   # specify the python exec
```

- From the command line (assuming `spams` package is installed):
```bash
# c.f. previous point for the different options
python -c "from spams.tests import test_spams; test_spams()"
```

## Authorship

SPAMS is developed and maintained by [Julien Mairal](http://julien.mairal.org) (Inria), and contains sparse estimation methods resulting from collaborations with various people: notably, [Francis Bach](http://www.di.ens.fr/~fbach), [Jean Ponce](http://www.di.ens.fr/~ponce), Guillermo Sapiro, [Rodolphe Jenatton](http://www.di.ens.fr/~jenatton/) and [Guillaume Obozinski](http://imagine.enpc.fr/~obozinsg/).

It is coded in C++ with a Matlab interface. Interfaces for R and Python have been developed by Jean-Paul Chieze, and archetypal analysis was written by Yuansi Chen.

Release of version 2.6/2.6.1 and porting to R-3.x and Python3.x was done by [Ghislain Durif](https://gdurif.perso.math.cnrs.fr/) (Inria). The original porting to Python3.x is based on [this patch](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/python-spams-svn/) and on the work of John Kirkham available [here](https://github.com/conda-forge/python-spams-feedstock).

Version 2.6.2 (Python only) update is based on contributions by [Francois Rheault](https://github.com/frheault) and [Samuel Saint-Jean](http://samuelstjean.github.io/).

### Maintenance

Since version 2.6.3+, SPAMS (especially the Python version) is now maintained by the following team:

- [Alessandro Daducci](https://github.com/daducci)
- [Ghislain Durif](https://gdurif.perso.math.cnrs.fr/)
- [Francois Rheault](https://github.com/frheault)
- [Samuel Saint-Jean](http://samuelstjean.github.io/)
