# Tootbot

This is a Python bot that looks up posts from specified subreddits and automatically posts them on [Mastodon][1].
It is based on [reddit-twitter-bot][2].

**!!! This version of Tootbot no longer supports posting to Twitter. !!!**
If you need twitter functionality look into [reddit-twitter-bot][2] as a possible alternative.

**!!! This version of Tootbot no longer supports deleting old toots. !!!**
If you'd like to delete older toots from your Mastodon account look into [MastodonAmnesia][3] as a tool that might
work for you.

**Features:**

* Tootbot posts to [Mastodon][1]
* Media from direct links, Gfycat, Imgur, Reddit, and Giphy is automatically attached in the social media post.
  Tootbot attaches up to the first 4 pictures for imgur albums and reddit gallery posts.
* Links that do not contain media can be skipped, ideal for meme accounts like [@babyelephantgifs][4]
* NSFW content, spoilers, and self-posts can be filtered
* Tootbot can monitor multiple subreddits at once
* Tootbot is fully open-source, so you don't have to give an external service full access to your social media accounts
* Tootbot also checks the sha256 checksum of media files to stop posting of the same media file from different subreddits.
* Tootbot can ping a [Healthchecks][5] instance for monitoring continuous operation of Tootbot
* Optionally throttle down frequency of tooting when mastodon errors are detected.
