Emencia Django Staticpages
==========================

A simple Django app to publish some pages directly from templates.

This is a layer over usage of Django class based view ``TemplateView`` to simply define
a list of static pages using a template name or with some more options.

.. warning:
    Version 0.5.0 is a full refactoring that will be incompatible with previous usage
    and configuration, it is a totally new way. Also Python3.6 Django<2.2 supports have
    been dropped.

    Old projects which used this library may have to stick to the 0.4.0 version.
