# ALIS: Algorithmic Library for Scalability

ALIS: Algorithmic Library for Scalability is a Python package and a good accompanying reference for Leskovec, Rajaraman, and Ullman's [Mining of Massive Datasets](http://www.mmds.org/). This book currently covers topics from Chapters 3 through 5, and Chapter 10 of the reference.

This book provides:

1. Additional mathematical and code examples
2. Additional exercises both theoretical and practical
3. Re-useable API for scalable data mining

ALIS is inspired by the [Dive into Deep Learning](https://d2l.ai/index.html) interactive book with code, math, and discussion.
