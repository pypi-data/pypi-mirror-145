Basic PDFs
##########

Basic shapes are fundamendal PDFs, with often well-known functional form.
They are usually fully analytically implemented and often a thin
wrapper around :py:class:`~tensorflow_probability.distribution.Distribution`.
Any missing shape can be easily wrapped using :py:class:`~zfit.pdf.WrapDistribution`.

Polynomials
#############

While polynomials are also basic PDFs, they convey mathematically
a more special class of functions.

They constitute a sum of different degrees.

KDEs provide a means of non-parametric density estimation.

An extensive introduction and explanation can be found in

Custom base class
#############################

These base classes are used internally to build PDFs and can also be
used to implement custom PDFs.

They offer more or less support and freedom.
