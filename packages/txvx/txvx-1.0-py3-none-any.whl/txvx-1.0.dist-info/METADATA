`pip install txvx`
####Windows
Address:)

### 2,Use
In you python code, write 'import txvx' <br>
and new a object
so...... <br>

    import txvx
    
    Txvx = txvx.run(FilePath)

### 3,Functions

| Functions  | Use             | Do                                                  |
|------------|-----------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| get()      | get(var)        | get Config File {var} value                         |
| set()      | set(var, value) | set Config File {var} value                         |
| create()   | create()        | Create a new Config File(If it existed would erase) |
| add()      | add(var, vaule) | add a new config vaule                              |
| remove()   | remove(var)     | delete vaule and return the config vaule            |
| save()     | save()          | save infomation from RAM                            |
| show()     | show()          | return all registered vaule                         |
| showType() | showType()      | return now Type                                     |
| new()      | new(List)       | Look Last!                                          |
| serach()   | serach(Item)|   | Search Item(if has return true, else return false)  |
### 4, Txvx file format

Under normal circumstances (there is no abnormal situation), the configuration files are all suffixed with '.txvx'<br>
For example: see nm's see.txvx

Internal files usually look like this

    example=5
    example1=Hello, World
    Writer=FZZkill

but

    I'm an idiot
This is wrong because it has no value, you should write even null

    I'm not a fool=

Notes:
I didn't expect to put it, this broken thing has a comment!

    # Note: only at the beginning
### 5, a momentary misstep and eternal hatred!
When you change the file, please be sure to use the 'save()' function to save the file, this grandson will not automatically save it, which is very important!

Data is priceless, operate with care

### finally
Here comes the point

How to use the new method? This is the essence of the txvx method. Under normal circumstances, all functions need to pass the new method when reading the file registration.

Normally, this function needs to pass two values
    
    new([],type)
   
   What is [], this is easy to understand, in fact, it is to pass a list~~Why is the list []? I'm curious about this too, but that's the truth~

But this list is important, there are two cases:
    
    ['Registry','Cave']
    [['No ,This Registry','Niubia'],['CXKNMSL','LBWNB']]
 
So when to use it, you need to distinguish
    
    ['xx','xx']
    In this case, the incoming type value is 1
    is to add this list to the main list
    
    [[],[]]
    In this case, the incoming type value is 2 (default)
    This case is a direct override of the main list

### if you delete the object, it cannot save
