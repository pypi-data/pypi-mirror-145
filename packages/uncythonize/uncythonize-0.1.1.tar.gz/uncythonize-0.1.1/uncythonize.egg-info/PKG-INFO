Description: ============
        uncythonize
        ============
        
        This script strips cython code (.pyx files) down to python code, by
        replacing cython declarations (cdef) with python equivalents
        and stripping away type annotations.
        
        Limitations
        --------------
        
        This is a simple script working based on text substitutions.
        It does not handle, or even claim to handle, all valid cython syntax.
        
        Python 3.5 and above is required.
        
        UTF-8 input is required.
        
        Installation
        --------------
        
        ::
        
        	$ pip install uncythonize
        
        Usage
        ---------
        
        ::
        
        	$ uncythonize.py filename.pyx
        
        will produce a corresponding file filename.pyx.py
        
        That file can then be run through various syntax checkers and linters,
        such as pyflakes, pydocstyle, pylint, vulture, pystrict3.
        
        It is useful to substitute in output of these tools back the original
        filename, filename.pyx.py -> filename.pyx
        
        Line numbering is preserved by this tool.
        
        More than one file can be processed.
