## Installation

You need python3 installed, either install it via Brew or Command Line Tools

```bash
pip install macos-virt
```

Or within a virtualenv to be cleaner:

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install macos-virt
```

### Prerequisites

* macOS Monterey (12.3+)
* Intel or Arm Mac.

> :warning: **This package contains a swift binary called macos-virt-runner. It is not signed. An attempt is made to sign it using your Mac's inbuilt cert, if this causes you any problems open an issue.**

> :warning: **This is alpha software. Please don't run your production DB on this.**

### Features

* Quickstart seamless setup, 5 minutes until your VM is ready to use.
* Any prerequisite kernels/initrds/root filesystems are downloaded automatically.
* Selection of VM profiles (all based on ubuntu for now)
* Ability to copy files to/from the VM
* Uses latest kernel in your VM to boot - Kernel updates are applied.
* Wake from Suspend notification to keep VM time in sync
* Mount Host directories to the VM using sshfs (Native Virtualization.Framework implementation seems unreliable)
* Shell Completion
* Less than 1MB in size (slightly more with dependencies)

# What it doesn't do

* MacOS guests
* Memory Ballooning
* VM Suspend/Resume
* Any Graphical Desktops
