BentoML is an open platform that simplifies ML model deployment and enables you to serve your models at production scale in minutes

👉 [Pop into our Slack community!](https://l.linklyhq.com/l/ktOh) We're happy to help with any issue you face or even just to meet you and hear what you're working on :)

__The BentoML version 1.0 is around the corner.__ For stable release version 0.13, see
the [0.13-LTS branch](https://github.com/bentoml/BentoML/tree/0.13-LTS). Version 1.0 is 
under active development, you can be of great help by testing out the preview release, 
reporting issues, contribute to the documentation and create sample gallery projects.

## Why BentoML ##

- The easiest way to turn your ML models into production-ready API endpoints.
- High performance model serving, all in Python.
- Standardize model packaging and ML service definition to streamline deployment.
- Support all major machine-learning training [frameworks](https://docs.bentoml.org/en/latest/frameworks/index.html).
- Deploy and operate ML serving workload at scale on Kubernetes via [Yatai](https://github.com/bentoml/yatai).

## Getting Started ##

- [Quickstart guide](https://docs.bentoml.org/en/latest/quickstart.html) will show you a simple example of using BentoML in action. In under 10 minutes, you'll be able to serve your ML model over an HTTP API endpoint, and build a docker image that is ready to be deployed in production.
- [Main concepts](https://docs.bentoml.org/en/latest/concepts/index.html) will give a comprehensive tour of BentoML's components and introduce you to its philosophy. After reading, you will see what drives BentoML's design, and know what `bento` and `runner` stands for.
- [ML Frameworks](https://docs.bentoml.org/en/latest/frameworks/index.html) lays out best practices and example usages by the ML framework used for training models.
- [Advanced Guides](https://docs.bentoml.org/en/latest/guides/index.html) showcases advanced features in BentoML, including GPU support, inference graph, monitoring, and customizing docker environment etc.

### Usage Reporting ###

BentoML collects anonymous usage data that helps our team to improve the product.
Only BentoML's internal API calls and CLI commands are being reported. We strip out as much potentially 
sensitive information as possible, and we will never collect user code, model data, model names, or stack traces.
Here's the [code](./bentoml/_internal/utils/analytics/usage_stats.py) for usage tracking.
You can opt-out of usage tracking by the `--do-not-track` CLI option:
```bash
bentoml [command] --do-not-track
```

Or by setting environment variable `BENTOML_DO_NOT_TRACK=True`:
```bash
export BENTOML_DO_NOT_TRACK=True
```
