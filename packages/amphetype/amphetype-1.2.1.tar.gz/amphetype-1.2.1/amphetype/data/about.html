<h1>Amphetype</h1>

<p>Version <big><strong>${VERSION}</strong></big></p>

<p>Made with love by Frank &lt;<a href="mailto:tristesse@gmail.com">tristesse@gmail.com</a>&gt;</p>

<dl>
  <dt>lesson</dt><dd>A text of suitable length. This could be anything: an
  excerpt from a book or file, just a random collection of words (as an
  auto-generated lesson), and so on.</dd>
  <dt>source</dt><dd>
    <p>A named collection of lessons, for example the name of a
  file. A source is generated automatically when importing a file. After import
  the file is no longer needed as the lessons are stored in Amphetype's internal
      database.</p>

    <p>(To delete a full source, [disable] all its lessons, and then [delete disabled].)</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>WPM (words per minute)</dt><dd>This is <em>defined</em> as 12 x (keys per second), i.e. the a "word" is defined as five keypresses.
   </dd>
   <dt>portable install (database and settings)</dt><dd>
     <p>The settings is (by default) stored in a file called amphetype.ini. Its location varies based on OS, but it should be where
     programs usually store configs. The database (containing all statistics as well as full copies of extracted lessons) will usually
     be called USERNAME.db where USERNAME is your login name on the computer. The database roughly corresponds to a "profile" so if several
       people wanted to use Amphetype on the same computer with a single user they'd probably use different database files.</p>

     <p>Both of these files can be specified at the command line with parameters "--settings file.ini" and "--database file.db",
       tho technically only the setting file is necessary for full portable profile since the settings file specifies the database.</p>

     <p>Another alternative is to use the command line parameter "--local" which
     makes Amphetype read/save its local data wherever it is installed (for
       example on a USB drive).</p>
     <p>See also "--help" for more command line options.</p>

     <p>If you don't know what command line parameters are or how to specify them, the best I can do is try
       searching for "windows how to edit command line parameters" or similar.</p>
     <p>(On the other side of the spectrum, for more advanced usage, you can
     also use environment variables
       to set most of these options, like AMPH_LOGFILE, AMPH_SETTINGS, AMPH_LOCAL.)
     </p>
   </dd>
  <dt>viscosity</dt><dd>
    <p>When I originally wrote the program and started
      pushing myself to type faster, I noticed there were certain words
      and key combinations that felt very awkward or uncomfortable and slowed me down.
      They were very noticeable subjectively, giving a somewhat cramped feeling in my hand, the finger movements
      seemingly breaking apart into hesitating spider-like jerks. It made my flow feel viscous.
      And I made some ad hoc attempt at coming up with a statistic for identifying these words and combinations.
    </p>

    <p>
      It was originally calculated roughly as the sum of statistical variance on each key.
      Later (for Typer 2) I changed it to looking only at the variance of keys that were slower than average.

      But neither method is very well thought out, nor theoretically sound. You can probably ignore this number. I'm not really sure what
      the best measure would be.
    </p>
  </dd>
   <dt>key shortcuts</dt><dd>Ctrl-Q quits.</dd>
   <dt>can't type character / refuses to accept input</dt>
   <dd>
     <p>Amphetype requires the exact character as input. If the text asks for "—" (em dash) then "-" (hyphen) won't work, ordinarily.

     The "force ASCII" option will try to change unicode symbols like these (“fancy”
     quote characters, ellipses (…),
       etc.) into regular ASCII equivalents.</p>

     <p>Another option is to edit the file you're importing from directly. Just make sure you're not using an editor
     that might change the text in unexpected ways on save (like Microsoft Word?). Be careful also when copy-pasting
     text from the web, so it doesn't contain weirdness like invisible space
       characters.</p>

<p>
  This is a complicated program so it's tough to cover everything, but an example workflow might be the following (which is how I personally used it).
</p>
<ul>
  <li>In a fresh install I'll download the text-file I want to type from Gutenberg. I'll edit it to remove all the legal notices.</li>
  <li>In the Sources tab I'll import the file via the Import Text button. This gives a new "Source" (named collections of lessons)</li>
  <li></li>
</ul>
