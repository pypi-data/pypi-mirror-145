                        Example: --file-ext='log,txt'
                        Defaults to:
                            all - for file server uploads
                            owl - for triple store uploads
--subdirs=<dir>         Optional subdirectories to be created on
                        the file server to upload your files into.
                        Example: --subdirs='dir1/dir2/'

                        Defaults to:
                            fs_uploader.log - for file server uploads
                            ts_uploader.log - for triple store uploads
--log-file-dir=<dir>    Path to the log file storing information of
                        what has been uploaded and where. Defaults
                        to the <file_or_dir> directory.
