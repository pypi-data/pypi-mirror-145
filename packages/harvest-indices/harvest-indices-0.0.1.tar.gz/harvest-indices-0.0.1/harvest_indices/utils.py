This package enables the calculation of traditional harvest indices THI (such as 
frequently used by central European farmers), the Standardized Harvest Index SHI 
that we developped to analyze the harvest data base cropdata.de (please check 
cropdata.de/about for more information also about a paper that we are currently
writing) and finally we also implemented the Relative Harvest Index RHI similar 
as e.g. in Ben-Ari et al (2018) and Beillouin et al. (2020). With these indices 
it is possible to analyze harvest anomalies on historical harvest data. 

For questions, bugs and ideas please contact me via info@cropdata.de

We are planning to submit a paper covering the package in detail.
