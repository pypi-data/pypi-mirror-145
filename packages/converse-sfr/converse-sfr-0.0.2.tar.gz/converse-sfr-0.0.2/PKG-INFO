## Getting Started

### Requirements

- python >= 3.7

### Running the NLU (NER/Intent/Coreference) services
- Please check out [running NLU services in docker container](Converse/nlu/README_nlu.md)

### Running the Demo - Quick Start

If you don't plan to edit the package code, we recommend using this method of running Converse because it is easier.

1. Install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).
2. Create a Python 3.7 virtual environment using [Conda](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html) and activate it.
3. Run the following command to install the pip package of Converse:
   ```
   pip install -i https://test.pypi.org/pypi/ --extra-index-url https://pypi.org/simple converse-test-command==0.2.16
   ```
4. Install `svn` on your computer. On Mac, run:
   ```
   brew install svn
   ```
5. Run `converse-shell` to test if the package is successfully installed.
If the command line output contains `"Hello, Converse!"`, then you installed the package successfully.
6. Run `converse-demo` to interact with pre-built example bots, and follow the instructions in your terminal.
Note that first-time users can leave every required input empty to use the default value.
Open the link provided by the script using your favorite browser, then you should see the demo page (pictured below).
You can interact with the bot by typing in the chat box on the right and the tree visualization will change based on
your task progress. Remember that the example bots are not open-domain chatbots. Please check
[Template Bots](./documentation/Template_bots.md) for the details of the template bots before you run the demo.

7. Run `converse-build` to configure your own bot. Follow the instructions in the terminal to set up the bot.
Note that first-time users can leave every required input empty to use the default value.
Open the link provided by the script using your favorite browser, then you should see the configuration page
(pictured below). To learn more about how to build your own bot, please refer to
[guide for building your first bot](./documentation/Build_your_first_bot.md).

### Running the Demo After Modifying Files in Converse

1. Clone this repo and `cd` into the `Converse` directory
    ```
    git clone git@github.com:salesforce/Converse.git
    cd Converse
    ```
2. Create a Python 3.7 virtual environment using [Conda](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html).
3. Install dependencies. All the necessary packages are listed in `requirements.txt`. You can install all the
   dependencies by running the following command:
    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
4. Add the `Converse` folder to your `PYTHONPATH`.
   ```
   export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:/your_directory/Converse
   ```
5. In one terminal window, run the backend and check the log file converse.log:
    ```
    LOGLEVEL=[debug|info|warning|error|critical] python Converse/demo/dial_backend.py
    ```
   You may want to specify custom config files. Supply `--help` option to help you out. The default config files are
   listed in `orchestrator.py` file.
6. In a separate terminal window, run the entity backend services:
    ```
    python Converse/entity_backend/entity_service_backend.py
    ```
7. In a separate terminal window, run the front end and start interacting with the bot!
    ```
    python Converse/demo/client.py
    ```
   You can interact with the bot directly in the command line or in the browser by opening http://localhost:9002/client
   in your favorite browser.  To learn more about how to build your own bot, please refer to
   [guide for building your first bot](./documentation/Build_your_first_bot.md).
