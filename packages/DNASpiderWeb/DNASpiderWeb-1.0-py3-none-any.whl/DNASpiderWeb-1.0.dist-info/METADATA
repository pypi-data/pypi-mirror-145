As a genetic material, DNA has become an attractive medium for storing digital information gradually. Besides the biochemical progress on DNA synthesis and sequencing, novel coding algorithms need to be constructed catering to the specific constraints in DNA storage. In recent years, a growing number of functional biochemical operations and storage environments were introduced, bringing in various biochemical constraints including but not confined to long single-nucleotide repeats and abnormal GC content. Given several local biochemical constraints and their combinations, the code rate capacity and capacity-achieving coding algorithms require in-depth investigation. In this work, we design an automatic generator, named SPIDER-WEB, to create corresponding graph-based algorithms which could be used directly or served as a benchmark for the construction of coding algorithms. The main advantage of SPIDER-WEB is that it provides an efficient way to applicable coding algorithms for arbitrary local biochemical constraints in an automatic way and support for probabilistic error correction and one-time pad encryption.
