(expiration)=
# {fa}`clock` Expiration
By default, cached responses will be stored indefinitely. There are a number of options for
specifying how long to store responses, either with a single expiration value, glob patterns,
or {ref}`cache headers <headers>`.

The simplest option is to initialize the cache with an `expire_after` value, which will apply to all
reponses:
```python
>>> # Set expiration for the session using a value in seconds
>>> session = CachedSession(expire_after=360)
```

(precedence)=
## Expiration Precedence
Expiration can be set on a per-session, per-URL, or per-request basis, in addition to cache
headers (see sections below for usage details). When there are multiple values provided for a given
request, the following order of precedence is used:
1. Cache-Control response headers (if enabled)
2. Cache-Control request headers
3. Per-request expiration (`expire_after` argument for {py:meth}`.CachedSession.request`)
4. Per-URL expiration (`urls_expire_after` argument for {py:class}`.CachedSession`)
5. Per-session expiration (`expire_after` argument for {py:class}`.CacheBackend`)

## Expiration Values
`expire_after` can be any of the following:
- `-1` (to never expire)
- `0` (to "expire immediately," e.g. bypass the cache)
- A positive number (in seconds)
- A {py:class}`~datetime.timedelta`
- A {py:class}`~datetime.datetime`

Examples:
```python
>>> # To specify a unit of time other than seconds, use a timedelta
>>> from datetime import timedelta
>>> session = CachedSession(expire_after=timedelta(days=30))

>>> # Update an existing session to disable expiration (i.e., store indefinitely)
>>> session.settings.expire_after = -1

>>> # Disable caching by default, unless enabled by other settings
>>> session = CachedSession(expire_after=0)
```

(url-patterns)=
## Expiration With URL Patterns
You can use `urls_expire_after` to set different expiration values based on URL glob patterns.
This allows you to customize caching based on what you know about the resources you're requesting
or how you intend to use them. For example, you might request one resource that gets updated
frequently, another that changes infrequently, and another that never changes. Example:
```python
>>> urls_expire_after = {
...     '*.site_1.com': 30,
...     'site_2.com/resource_1': 60 * 2,
...     'site_2.com/resource_2': 60 * 60 * 24,
...     'site_2.com/static': -1,
... }
>>> session = CachedSession(urls_expire_after=urls_expire_after)
```

**Notes:**
- `urls_expire_after` should be a dict in the format `{'pattern': expire_after}`
- `expire_after` accepts the same types as `CachedSession.settings.expire_after`
- Patterns will match request **base URLs without the protocol**, so the pattern `site.com/resource/`
  is equivalent to `http*://site.com/resource/**`
- If there is more than one match, the first match will be used in the order they are defined
- If no patterns match a request, `CachedSession.settings.expire_after` will be used as a default

(request-errors)=
## Expiration and Error Handling
In some cases, you might cache a response, have it expire, but then encounter an error when
retrieving a new response. If you would like to use expired response data in these cases, use the
`stale_if_error` option.

For example:
```python
>>> # Cache a test response and wait until it's expired
>>> session = CachedSession(stale_if_error=True)
>>> session.get('https://httpbin.org/get', expire_after=1)
>>> time.sleep(1)
```

Afterward, let's say the page has moved and you get a 404, or the site is experiencing downtime and
you get a 500. You will then get the expired cache data instead:
```python
>>> response = session.get('https://httpbin.org/get')
>>> print(response.from_cache, response.is_expired)
True, True
```

In addition to HTTP error codes, `stale_if_error` also applies to python exceptions (typically a
{py:exc}`~requests.RequestException`). See `requests` documentation on
[Errors and Exceptions](https://2.python-requests.org/en/master/user/quickstart/#errors-and-exceptions)
for more details on request errors in general.

## Removing Expired Responses
For better read performance, expired responses won't be removed immediately, but will be removed
(or replaced) the next time they are requested.
:::{tip}
Implementing one or more cache eviction algorithms is being considered. If this is something you are
interested in, please provide feedback via [issues](https://github.com/reclosedev/requests-cache/issues)!
:::

To manually clear all expired responses, use
{py:meth}`.CachedSession.remove_expired_responses`:
```python
>>> session.remove_expired_responses()
```

Or, when using patching:
```python
>>> requests_cache.remove_expired_responses()
```

You can also apply a new `expire_after` value to previously cached responses:
```python
>>> session.remove_expired_responses(expire_after=timedelta(days=30))
```

## Request Options
In addition to the base arguments for {py:func}`requests.request`, requests-cache adds some extra
cache-related arguments. These apply to {py:meth}`.CachedSession.request`,
{py:meth}`.CachedSession.send`, and all HTTP method-specific functions (`get()`, `post()`, etc.).

### Per-Request Expiration
The `expire_after` argument can be used to override the session's expiration for a single request.
```python
>>> session = CachedSession(expire_after=300)
>>> # This request will be cached for 60 seconds, not 300
>>> session.get('http://httpbin.org/get', expire_after=60)
```

### Manual Refresh
If you want to manually refresh a response before it expires, you can use the `refresh` argument.
This will always send a new request, and ignore and overwrite any previously cached response. The
response will be saved with a new expiration time, according to the normal expiration rules described above.
```python
>>> response = session.get('http://httpbin.org/get')
>>> response = session.get('http://httpbin.org/get', refresh=True)
>>> assert response.from_cache is False
```

A related argument is `revalidate`, which is basically a "soft refresh." It will send a quick
{ref}`conditional request <conditional-requests>` to the server, and use the cached response if the
remote content has not changed. If the cached response does not contain validation headers, this
option will have no effect.

### Cache-Only Requests
If you want to only use cached responses without making any real requests, you can use the
`only_if_cached` option. This essentially uses your cache in "offline mode". If a response isn't
cached or is expired, you will get a `504 Not Cached` response instead.
```python
>>> session = CachedSession()
>>> session.cache.clear()
>>> response = session.get('http://httpbin.org/get', only_if_cached=True)
>>> print(response.status_code)
504
>>> response.raise_for_status()
HTTPError: 504 Server Error: Not Cached for url: http://httpbin.org/get
```

You can also combine this with `stale_if_error` to return cached responses even if they are expired.
```python
>>> session = CachedSession(expire_after=1, stale_if_error=True)
>>> session.get('http://httpbin.org/get')
>>> time.sleep(1)

>>> # The response will be cached but expired by this point
>>> response = session.get('http://httpbin.org/get', only_if_cached=True)
>>> print(response.status_code)
200
```
