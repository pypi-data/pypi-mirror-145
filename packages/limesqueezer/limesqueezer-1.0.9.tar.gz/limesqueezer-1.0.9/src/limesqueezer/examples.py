# You have some data from system of equations
# For example, let's take 100 000 datapoints along some 2nd degree polynomial

# Now you want to compress it with maximum error being

# Or maybe you have some generator-like thing that gives out numbers.
# E.g. PBOS simulation step
# Here you use the context manager "Stream"
# Initialise with first values, here I am just going to use the first
