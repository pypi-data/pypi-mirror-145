    Differentiable implementation of a histogram using kernel density estimation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    events: (jax array-like) 1D data!
    bins: (jax array-like) intervals to calculate counts.
    bandwidth: (float) value that specifies the width of the individual
        distributions (kernels), whose cdfs are averaged over each bin. Defaults
        to Scott's rule -- the same as scipy's.
    density: (bool) whether or not to normalize the histogram to unit area.
    reflect_infinities: (bool) if true, reflect  under/overflow bins into boundary bins.
    doing so will ensure (normalised) unit total density,
    as kdes have infinite support.

    Returns
    -------
    counts: 1D array of binned counts
