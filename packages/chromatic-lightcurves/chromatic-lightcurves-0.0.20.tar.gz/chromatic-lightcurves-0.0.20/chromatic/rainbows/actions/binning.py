    """
    Bin the rainbow in wavelength and/or time.

    The time-setting order of precendence is
    [`time`, `dt`], meaning that if `time` is set,
    any values given for `dt` will be ignored.
    The wavelength-setting order of precendence is
    [`wavelength`, `dw`, `R`], meaning that if `wavelength`
    is set any values of `dw` or `R` will be ignored, and
    if `dw` is set any value of `R` will be ignored.

    Parameters
    ----------
    dt : astropy.units.Quantity
        The d(time) bin size for creating a grid
        that is uniform in linear space.
    time : array of astropy.units.Quantity
        An array of times, if you just want to give
        it an entirely custom array.
    ntimes : int
        A fixed number of times to bin together.
    R : float
        The spectral resolution for creating a grid
        that is uniform in logarithmic space.
    dw : astropy.units.Quantity
        The d(wavelength) bin size for creating a grid
        that is uniform in linear space.
    wavelength : array of astropy.units.Quantity
        An array of wavelengths for the centers of bins,
        if you just want to give an entirely custom array.
    wavelength_edges : array of astropy.units.Quantity
        An array of wavelengths for the edges of bins,
        if you just want to give an entirely custom array.
        The bins will span `wavelength_edges[:-1]` to
        `wavelength_edges[1:]`, so the resulting binned
        Rainbow will have `len(wavelength_edges) - 1`
        wavelength bins associated with it.
    nwavelengths : int
        A fixed number of wavelengths to bin together.

    Returns
    -------
    binned : Rainbow
        The binned Rainbow.
