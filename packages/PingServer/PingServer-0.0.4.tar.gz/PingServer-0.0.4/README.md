# PingServer

PingServer is a python package that makes things more convenient to set up a server to be pinged by uptimerobot.com this package is most useful on sites like replit.com where your program might shut down after being idle for too long


## Usage

First import the package with:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`pip install PingServer`
Then import it with:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`import PingServer`
Then add this one line to start the server:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`PingServer.start_server()`
The `start_server()` command has an optional parameter for a message on the web page to be pinged.
It's just that simple enjoy.

## Background

This is the first python package I have ever made and is somewhat of a tutorial for myself with something I will be able to use for things like discord bots on replit.com and more.
