WindKit API
==============

The ``windkit`` module contains several modules for reading and writing WAsP specific files, as well as performing common geospatial operations on these datasets. These are split into three groups, wind climate data, topographic data, and geospatial tools. You can find an introduction to each of these areas below.

.. _wind_climate_data_api:

Wind Climate objects
--------------------

WAsP works with a number of different :ref:`wind_climates`, which each have their own API. All wind climates have an xarray.Dataset backend, and the binned wind climate (**bwc**) and generalized wind climate (**gwc**) have `dataset accessors <http://xarray.pydata.org/en/stable/internals.html#extending-xarray>`_ that can be used to provide wind specific calculations.

.. _wind_climate_tools_api:

Wind Climate tools

.. _topographic_data_api:

Topographic Data
----------------

:ref:`topographic_data` provides the roughness and elevation data that is used to model the wind resource. The tools in WindKit allow you to work with both raster and vector based maps, and use the powerful GDAL library behind the scenes to enable a wide variety of file formats to be used.

    :toctree: topo_autogen

    windkit.get_map


.. _geospatial_tools_api:

Geospatial Tools
----------------

The WindKit Geospatial Tools allow you to perform common GIS functions such as convert between the different :ref:`geospatial_structures`, reproject or warp the data into common projections, and clip or mask the data based on additional data sources.

In addition to the provided tools, since WindKit stores its objects in the formats of powerful python libraries, you can also make use of additional `geopandas <https://geopandas.org/>`_ functions for vector data, and additional `xarray <http://xarray.pydata.org>`_ functions for raster data.

Throughout this documentation, the following abbreviations are used to reference different data types.

* geodf - either a `geopandas.GeoDataFrame` or `geopandas.GeoSeries`
* xr_data - either an `xarray.DataArray` or `xarray.Dataset`
* CRS - `pyproj.crs.CRS`

.. _plotting_api:

Plotting
--------

WindKit Plotting allows you to execute a number of different plotting functions in order to visualize and analyze your data. Plots are largely broken into two categories; statistical and maps. Statistical plots are generally plotted using Plotly and Dash Python libraries at a single location, e.g. mast or turbine location, while maps use `geopandas <https://geopandas.org/>`_ and `xarray <http://xarray.pydata.org>`_ functions directly to show an overview of the area.
