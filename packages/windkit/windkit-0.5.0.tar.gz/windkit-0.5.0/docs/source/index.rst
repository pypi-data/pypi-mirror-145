WindKit
=======

WindKit provides a pythonic interface to read, write, and analyse many of the file formats used in the WAsP wind resource assessment program. Over time the project will include additional file types, and work to standardize the structures that are used in Wind Resource Assessment.

.. note:: WindKit does not provide the interface to calculate WAsP results. For that you will need PyWAsP, which requires a PyWAsP License.
