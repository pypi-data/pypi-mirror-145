CDK construct to deploy docker image to Amazon ECR

## Features

* Copy an ECR image to another
* Copy docker hub image to ECR
* Copy an archive tarball image from s3 to ECR

## Examples

Run [test/integ.ecr-deployment.ts](./test/integ.ecr-deployment.ts)

```shell
NO_PREBUILT_LAMBDA=1 npx cdk deploy -a "npx ts-node -P tsconfig.dev.json --prefer-ts-exts test/integ.ecr-deployment.ts"
```

## Tech Details & Contribution

The core of this project relies on https://github.com/containers/image which is used by https://github.com/containers/skopeo.
Please take a look at those projects before contribution.

To support a new docker image source(like docker tarball in s3), you need to implement [image transport interface](https://github.com/containers/image/blob/master/types/types.go). You could take a look at [docker-archive](https://github.com/containers/image/blob/ccb87a8d0f45cf28846e307eb0ec2b9d38a458c2/docker/archive/transport.go) transport for a good start.

To test the `lambda` folder, `make test`.
