## Tech Details & Contribution

The core of this project relies on https://github.com/containers/image which is used by https://github.com/containers/skopeo.
Please take a look at those projects before contribution.

To support a new docker image source(like docker tarball in s3), you need to implement [image transport interface](https://github.com/containers/image/blob/master/types/types.go). You could take a look at [docker-archive](https://github.com/containers/image/blob/ccb87a8d0f45cf28846e307eb0ec2b9d38a458c2/docker/archive/transport.go) transport for a good start.

To test the `lambda` folder, `make test`.
