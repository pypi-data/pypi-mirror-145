Yet Another Word Processor, an automatic word processor for text files, with PDF output

                       I sound my barbaric yawp over the roofs of the world

                                                               Walt Whitman

The  name  "yawp"  here  means  Yet  Another Word Processor, and yawp is an
automatic  word  processor  for  plain  text files, with PDF output. If you
really  need all the features of a full-fledged WYSIWYG word processor like
LibreOffice  Writer,  yawp is not for you. But if you just want to create a
simple quick-and-dirty no-frills document, with yawp you can:

    • edit a text file by your favorite editor
    • run yawp in order to:
        • backup read format and rewrite the text file
        • export the text file in a PDF file
        • open the PDF file for check or print
    • possibly go back to the editor and update the text file, or finish

Main features are:

    • yawp  processes  in place a single text file, hereinafter referred to
      simply as the "file"
    • yawp  before  processing  makes  a  timestamped  backup  of the file,
      allowing undo operation
    • yawp  processing  is  driven by the text in the file and by arguments
      only, not by commands or tags embedded in text
    • yawp justifies text at left and right in:
        • unindented paragraphs
        • dot-marked indented paragraphs (as this one)
    • yawp  accepts  unjustified  pictures  (as  schemas,  tables  and code
      examples) freely intermixed with text
    • yawp  adopts  an  ad  hoc  policy  for  Python  files, formatting the
      docstrings but not the Python code
    • yawp  performs  multi-level  chapter  renumbering
    • yawp  inserts  an  automatic  contents chapter in the file
    • yawp  recognizes  relevant  subjects  (quoted  by '"') and inserts an
      automatic index chapter in the file
    • yawp cuts the file in pages, by automatic insertion of two-lines page
      headers
    • yawp  also  has some limited graphic feature, you can sketch pictures
      with  segments (by '`') and arrowheads (by '^'), yawp redraws them by
      proper graphic characters (as in the picture above)
    • yawp  exports  the  resulting  lines in PDF format, with control over
      character  size  and page layout, and opens for you the generated PDF
      file, allowing preview and printing
    • yawp  corrects  errors  made  by  CUPS-PDF  about  font size and page
      margins
    • yawp is "stable", namely if after a yawp execution you run yawp again
      on  the  same  file  with  the  same  arguments then the file content
      doesn't  change

For example, if your Linux belongs to the Debian family, type:

    │ $ sudo apt-get -y update
    │ $ sudo apt-get -y install printer-driver-cups-pdf

If you don't have pip, type:

    │ $ sudo apt-get -y install python3-pip

If you type at terminal:

    │ $ pip3 install --upgrade yawp

this command will:

    • install current version of yawp if not present
    • upgrade yawp to the current version if already installed

If you see a message of this type:

    │ WARNING: The script yawp is installed in ... which is not on PATH.

don't worry, a reboot should fix the problem.

For any detail, see the yawp-generated "yawp Manual" by typing:
