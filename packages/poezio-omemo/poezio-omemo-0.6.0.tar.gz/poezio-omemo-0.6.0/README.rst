Poezio OMEMO plugin
###################

**This plugin will not work with Poezio 0.12.**


This is a `Poezio <https://poez.io>`_ plugin providing OMEMO support. It
distributed separately for licensing reasons.

This plugin is very much **alpha**. It handles encryption and decryption
of OMEMO messages, but doesn't display the encryption state of messages,
and neither does it have a way to do trust management. As this plugin is
still changing often, it is recommended that users follow experimental
(master) versions of this project and its dependencies.

License
-------

This plugin is licensed under GPLv3.

Note on the underlying OMEMO library
------------------------------------

As stated in `python-xeddsa's
README <https://github.com/Syndace/python-xeddsa/blob/136b9f12c8286b9463566308963e70f090b60e50/README.md>`_,
(dependency of python-omemo), this library has not undergone any
security audits. If you have the knowledge, any help is welcome.

Please take this into consideration when using this library.
