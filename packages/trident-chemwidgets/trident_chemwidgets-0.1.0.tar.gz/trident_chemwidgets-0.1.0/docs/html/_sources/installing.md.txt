# Installation

The simplest way to install trident_chemwidgets is via pip:

```
pip install trident_chemwidgets
```

or via conda:

```
conda install trident_chemwidgets
```

If you installed via pip, and notebook version \< 5.3, you will also have to
install / configure the front-end extension as well. If you are using classic
notebook (as opposed to Jupyterlab), run:

```
jupyter nbextension install [--sys-prefix / --user / --system] --py trident_chemwidgets

jupyter nbextension enable [--sys-prefix / --user / --system] --py trident_chemwidgets
```

with the [appropriate flag]. If you are using Jupyterlab, install the extension
with:

```
jupyter labextension install trident-chemwidgets
```

If you are installing using conda, these commands should be unnecessary, but if
you need to run them the commands should be the same (just make sure you choose the
`--sys-prefix` flag).
