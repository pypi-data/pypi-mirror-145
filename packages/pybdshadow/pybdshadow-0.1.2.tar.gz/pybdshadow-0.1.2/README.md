## Introduction

`pybdshadow` is a python package to generate building shadow geometry. The latest stable release of the software can be installed via pip and full documentation can be found [here](https://pybdshadow.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

## Example

Given a building GeoDataFrame and UTC datetime, `pybdshadow` can calculate the building shadow based on the sun position obtained by `suncalc`

```python
import pybdshadow
#Given UTC datetime
date = pd.to_datetime('2015-01-01 02:45:33.959797119')
#Calculate building shadow
shadows = pybdshadow.bdshadow_sunlight(buildings,date)
```

`pybdshadow` also provide visualization method supported by keplergl.

```python
# visualize buildings and shadows
pybdshadow.show_bdshadow(buildings = buildings,shadows = shadows)
```
