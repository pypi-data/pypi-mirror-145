Goals
-----

    "makefiles, but with pyproject.toml"

    -- author

`thx` should be capable of running one or more jobs or commands, configured via simple
and obvious options in the PEP 517 standardized `pyproject.toml`. Jobs are defined as
simple strings, or lists of strings, each representing a command to be run, with basic
interpolation of values.

.. code-block:: toml

    [tool.thx]
    default = ["lint", "test"]
    module = "thx"

    [tool.thx.jobs]
    lint = [
        "flake8 {module}",
        "ufmt check {module}",
    ]
    test = "python -m unittest -v {module}.tests"

With the given configuration, the following commands are possible. Note the automatic
replacement of ``{module}`` with ``thx``:

.. code-block:: shell-session

    $ thx lint
    > flake8 thx
    > ufmt check thx

.. code-block:: shell-session

    $ thx test
    > python -m unittest thx.tests

Without a command, ``thx`` will run the configured list of default jobs:

.. code-block:: shell-session

    $ thx
    > flake8 thx
    > ufmt check thx
    > python -m unittest thx.tests


Terminology
-----------

* `command` refers to an individual program executed by `thx` as a subprocess,
  including any rendered template values. An example command could include running unit
  tests via ``python -m unittest thx``.

* `step` refers to a pending command, before any template values are rendered, and
  includes the configuration, environment, and any other values that may affect the
  final program and arguments that will be executed.

* `job` refers to a named job, consisting of one or more steps, and a list of any other
  jobs that must be completed before this job can begin (`"requires"`). These are the
  primary unit defined in the project's ``pyproject.toml``.
