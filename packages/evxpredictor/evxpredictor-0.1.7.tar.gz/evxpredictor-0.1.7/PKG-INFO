# Evx predictor mlbot

This is a simple package used to generate buy and sell signals for crypto and conventional stock markets based on the excess volume indicator(EVX)  
You can read more about Evx in the whitepaper [here](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/345313655_DeFiPaper)

# Usage

In your python script simply import the module and use as follows  
from evxpredictor import mlbot

print(mlbot.signal(20,65,120, 0.98,'buy'))

The above methods take an assets opening, closing, and volume of the asset based on the time interval you have chosen, while the last variable is alpha, a probabilistic value. A zero classification output would instruct the user to sell, while one output means don't sell or buy if the asset is not already present in the orders.

You can use empty space instead of alpha to make use of the default value.
