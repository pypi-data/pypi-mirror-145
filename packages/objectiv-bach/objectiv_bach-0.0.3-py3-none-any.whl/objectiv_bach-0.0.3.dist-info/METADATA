# Objectiv Bach: Pandas-like DataFrames backed by SQL

Bach is Objectiv's data modeling library. With Bach, you can compose models with familiar Pandas-like dataframe operations in your notebook. It uses an SQL abstraction layer that enables models to run on the full dataset. It includes a set of operations that enable effective feature creation for datasets that embrace the [open taxonomy of analytics](/schema/README.md).

Bach uses [`sql_models`](./sql_models/) under the hood, which makes it possible to easily build graphs of SQL models and generate SQL for the resulting composite `sql-models`. See [sql_models/README.md](./sql_models/README.md) for more information.

## Using Bach
To use Bach, use the following command:
```bash
pip install objectiv-bach
```

If you want the latest and greatest from your local checkout, install objectiv_bach in edit mode:
```bash
pip install -e .
```

This will install Bach in edit mode, meaning you get the latest version from the local checkout.
For detailed installation & usage instructions, visit [Objectiv Docs](https://www.objectiv.io/docs).
