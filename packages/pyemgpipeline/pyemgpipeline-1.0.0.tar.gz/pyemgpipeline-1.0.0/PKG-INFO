# EMG Signal Processing Pipeline

**pyemgpipeline** is an electromyography (EMG) signal processing pipeline package.

This package implements internationally accepted EMG processing conventions
and provides a high-level interface for ensuring user adherence to those conventions,
in terms of (1) processing parameter values, (2) processing steps, and (3) processing step order.

The processing steps included in the package are
DC offset removal, bandpass filtering, full wave rectification, linear envelope,
end frame cutting, amplitude normalization, and segmentation.

## Scope

This package defines the processing pipeline for both surface EMG and
intramuscular EMG but not for high density EMG.
The EMG recording requires that the minimum sample rate be at least twice the
highest cutoff frequency of the bandpass filter based on the Nyquist theorem.

## Overview

In **pyemgpipeline**, class `DataProcessingManager` in module `wrappers` is
designed as the main wrapper for high-level, guided processing,
and users are encouraged to use it to adhere to accepted EMG processing conventions.
The other classes, methods, and functions are considered as lower level processing
options.

The package is organized in modules `processors`, `wrappers`, and `plots`.

Module `processors` includes the base class `BaseProcessor` of all signal
processors and seven classes for different processing steps:
`DCOffsetRemover`, `BandpassFilter`, `FullWaveRectifier`, `LinearEnvelope`,
`EndFrameCutter`, `AmplitudeNormalizer`, and `Segmenter`.

Module `wrappers` includes three wrapper classes to facilitate the signal
processing by integrating data and individual processors.
Class `EMGMeasurement` works for data of a single trial,
class `EMGMeasurementCollection` works for data of multiple trials,
and class `DataProcessingManager` is the high-level, guided processing wrapper
with EMG processing conventions.

Module `plots` includes
the function `plot_emg` to plot EMG signals on `matplotlib` figures
and the class `EMGPlotParams` to manage the plot-related parameters.
