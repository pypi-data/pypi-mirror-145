class BandpassFilter(BaseProcessor):
    """Bandpass filter for EMG signals

    Parameters
    ----------
    hz : float
        Sample rate in hertz.
        See class EMGMeasurementCollection for suggested values of hz.

    bf_order : int, default=4
        Effective order (i.e., order after two-directional filtering)
        of the butterworth filter. bf_order should be a multiple of 2.

    bf_cutoff_fq_lo : float, default=10
        Low cutoff frequency of the bandpass filter (i.e., frequency
        higher than bf_cutoff_fq_lo will pass).
        See Notes and References for some suggestions in different
        circumstances.

    bf_cutoff_fq_hi : float, default=450
        High cutoff frequency of the bandpass filter (i.e., frequency
        lower than bf_cutoff_fq_hi will pass).
        See Notes and References for some suggestions in different
        circumstances. Note that bf_cutoff_fq_hi should be strictly
        less than half of hz.

    Notes
    -----
    Ref [1] suggests a bandwidth of 10–350 Hz for surface recording,
    10–450 Hz for intramuscular recording, and 10–1500 Hz for needle
    recording.

    Ref [2] suggests a bandwidth of from 5-10 Hz to 400-450 Hz for
    surface EMG and a high cutoff of at least 1500 Hz for
    intramuscular and needle recordings.

    Ref [3] suggests a bandwidth of from 10-20 Hz to 500-1000 Hz for
    surface EMG.

    Ref [4] suggests a low cutoff of 30 Hz when the placement of
    surface EMG is around the heart on the trunk.
