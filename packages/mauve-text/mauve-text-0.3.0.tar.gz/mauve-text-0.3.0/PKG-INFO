# MAUVE

MAUVE is a library built on PyTorch and HuggingFace Transformers to measure the gap between neural text and human text 
with the eponymous MAUVE measure, 
introduced [in this paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.01454.pdf) (NeurIPS 2021 Ooutstanding Paper).


### [Documentation Link](krishnap25.github.io/mauve/)

### _New: MAUVE is available via [HuggingFace Datasets](https://huggingface.co/docs/datasets/how_to_metrics.html)!_


**Features**:
- MAUVE with quantization using *k*-means. 
- Adaptive selection of *k*-means hyperparameters. 
- Compute MAUVE using pre-computed GPT-2 features (i.e., terminal hidden state), 
    or featurize raw text using HuggingFace transformers + PyTorch.
- New: minibatching for efficient implementation. 

## Installation

For a direct install, run this command from your terminal:
```
pip install mauve-text
```
