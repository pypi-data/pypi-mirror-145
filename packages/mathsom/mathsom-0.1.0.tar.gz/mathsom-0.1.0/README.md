# mathsom

Math related library meant for personal use.

Contents:
- Solvers (function can contain more than one input): 
  - Newton Rhapson method (numerical differentiation)
  - Bisection method
- Numerical methods (function can contain more than one input):
  - Single variable differentiation
  - Single variable integration
- Interpolations (uses external libraries for performance, but handles different kind of inputs/outputs):
  - Linear
  - LogLinear
  - CubicSpline 
- Auxiliar functions:
  - Function standarization: convert function with multiple inputs to function with one input and other variable as constants f(x, y, z) -> g(x)
