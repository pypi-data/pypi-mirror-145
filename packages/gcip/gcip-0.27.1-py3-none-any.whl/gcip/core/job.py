"""This module represents the Gitlab CI [Job](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/yaml/README.html#job-keywords)

It contains the general `Job` class as well as a special `TriggerJob` class. The latter one is a subclass
of `Job` but has on the one hand reduced capabilities, on the other hand it has the additional functionality
to trigger other pipelines.

Here is a simple example how you define and use a `Job`:

```python
from gcip import Pipeline, Job

pipeline = Pipeline()
job = Job(stage="build", script="build my artefact")
pipeline.add_children(job, name="artifact")
pipeline.write_yaml()

# stages:
#   - build
# build-artifact:
#   stage: build
#   script: build my artifact
```

A `Job` has always a `script` and at least one of `stage` or `name`.
The `stage` will be used for the name of the stage of the job and the
job name itself, whereas `name` is only used for the job`s name. When adding
a job to a `gcip.core.pipeline.Pipeline` or a `gcip.core.sequence.Sequence`
you can and should define a `name` or `stage` too. This is how you
distinguish between two jobs of the same kind added to a pipeline:

```python
def create_build_job(artifact: str, job_name: str = "artifact", job_stage: str = "build") -> Job:
    return Job(name=job_name, stage=job_stage, script=f"build my {artifact}")

pipeline.add_children(create_build_job("foo"), name="bar")
pipeline.add_children(create_build_job("john"), name="deere")

# stages:
#   - build
# build-artifact-bar:
#   stage: build
#   script: build my foo
# build-artifact-deere:
#     stage: build
#     script: build my john
```

Again `name` or `stage` decide whether to add the string to the
stage of a job or not:

```python
def create_build_job(job_name: str = "artifact", job_stage: str = "build", artifact: str) -> Job:
    return Job(name=job_name, stage=job_stage, script=f"build my {artifact}")

pipeline.add_children(create_build_job("foo"), stage="bar")
pipeline.add_children(create_build_job("john"), stage="deere")

# stages:
#   - build_bar
#   - build_deere
# build-bar-artifact:
#   stage: build_bar
#   script: build my foo
# build-deere-artifact:
#     stage: build_deere
#     script: build my john
```

This also decides whether to run the jobs in parralel or sequential. When using
`stage` and adding the string also to the jobs stage the stages for both jobs
differ. When using `name` only the name of the jobs differ but the name of the stage
remains the same.

An `Job` object has a lot of methods for further configuration of typical Gitlab CI
[Job keywords]/https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/yaml/README.html#job-keywords), like
configuring tags, rules, variables and so on. Methods with names staring with..

* **`set_*`** will initally set or overwrite any previous setting, like `set_image()`
* **`add_*`** will append a value to previous ones, like `add_tags()`
* **`append_*`** will do the same as `add_*`, but for values where order matters. So it
   explicitly adds a value to the end of a list of previous values, like `append_rules()`
* **`prepend_*`** is the counterpart to `append_*` and will add a value to the beginning
  of a list of previous values, like `prepend_rules()`

        This class is used to check if Jobs matches certain criterias.

        When created, you could use the `equals` method, to check if `Job`s match the `JobFilter` criterias:

        ```
        filter = JobFilter(script="foo.*")
        job = Job(stage="test", script="foobar")
        assert filter.match(job)
        ```

        Check the arguments for all optional criterias:

        Args:
            script (Optional[Union[str, List[str]]], optional): Could be a single or a list of regular expressions. A job matches if for every regex provided
                there is a matching script in the job. Defaults to None.
            name (Optional[str], optional): A job matches if the regex provided matches the jobs name. ATTENTION: A jobs name is always composed of the name
                and stage parameter given to its init-Method, separated by a dash. Also all underscores are replaced by a dash. Defaults to None.
            stage (Optional[str], optional): A job matches if the regex provided matches the jobs stage. ATTENTION: A jobs stage is always the stage given to
                the jobs init-Method with all dashres replaces by underscores. Defaults to None.
            image (Optional[Union[Image, str]], optional): A job matches depending on the type of the value provided. If the parameter a regex (str), a job
                matches if the regex matches to the jobs image name. If the parameter is an `Image`, a job matches if the attributes of the `Image` provided
                equals to the `Image` attributes of the job. Defaults to None.
            allow_failure (Optional[bool]): A job matches if `allow_failure` matches to the value of this filter. The filter allows two special string
                values 'untouched' - which filters out jobs whose 'allow_failure' value has not been set before - as well as 'none' - which filters out
                jobs whose 'allow_failure' value has explicitly been set to None by the user.
            variables (Optional[Dict[str, str]], optional): The keys of the dictionary provided are variable names, the values are regular expressions.
                A job matches if it contains all variable names provided and their values matches the appropriate regular expressions. Defaults to None.
            tags (Optional[Union[str, List[str]]]): Could be a single or a list of regular expressions. A job matches if for every regex provided there is a
                matching tag in the job. Defaults to None.
            rules (Optional[Union[Rule, List[Rule]]], optional): A job matches if he contains all rules provided. The rules are compared by their equality
                of their attributes. Defaults to None.
            dependencies (Optional[Union[str, Job, Sequence, List[Union[str, Job, Sequence]]]]): A Job matches depending on the type of the value provided.
                If the value is a (list of) `Job`s or `Sequence`s, a job matches if that jobs `dependencies` contains all the Jobs and Sequences provided.
                Jobs and Sequences are compared by their identity. If the value is a list of strings representing regular expressions, a job matches if for
                every regex provided there is a need whith a job name matching to this regex. If the dependency is a sequence, at least one job from the sequence
                must match. Defaults to None.
            needs (Optional[List[Union[str, Need, Job, Sequence]]], optional): A job matches depending on the type of the value provided. If the value is a
                 (list of) `Job`s, `Sequence`s or `Need`s, a job matches if that jobs `needs` contains all the Jobs, Sequences and Needs provided. Jobs and
                 Sequences are compared by their identity. Needs are compared by their equality of their attributes. If the value is a list of strings
                 representing regular expressions, a job matches if for every regex provided there is a need whith a job name matching to this regex. If the
                 Need is a sequence, at least one job from the last stage must match. Defaults to None.
            artifacts (Optional[Union[Artifacts, List[str]]], optional): A job matches depending on the type of the value provided. If the value is an
                `Artifacts`, a job matches if its artifacts properties equals to the provided artifacts properties. If the value is a list of strings as
                regular expressions, a job matches if for every regex provided there is at least one matching path in the jobs artifacts object.
                Defaults to None.
            cache (Optional[Union[Cache, List[str]]], optional): A job matches depending on the type of the value provided. If the value is a `Cache`,
                a job matches if its `Cache` properties equals to the provided cache properties. If the value is a list of strings as regular expressions,
                a job matches if for every regex provided there is at least one matching path in the jobs artifacts object.
                ATTENTION: A caches internal path always starts with './'.  Defaults to None.

    Jobs with trigger can only use a [limited set of keywords](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/multi_project_pipelines.html#limitations).
    For example, you can’t run commands with `script`.

    Simple example:

        project (Optional[str]): The full name of another Gitlab project to trigger (multi-project pipeline trigger)
            Mutually exclusive with `includes`. Defaults to None.
        branch (Optional[str]): The branch of `project` the pipeline should be triggered of. Defaults to None.
        includes (Optional[List[Include]]): Include a pipeline to trigger (Parent-child pipeline trigger)
            Mutually exclusiv with `project`. Defaults to None.
        strategy (Optional[TriggerStrategy]): Determines if the result of this pipeline depends on the triggered downstream pipeline
            (use `TriggerStrategy.DEPEND`) or if just "fire and forget" the downstream pipeline (use `None`). Defaults to None.

        This is a special kind of jobs which deploys Gitlab Pages.

        This job has the static name `pages` and the static artifacts path `./public`. Both preconfigurations
        can't be altered and are required for deploying Gitlab Pages properly. All methods which would typically
        alter the name, stage and artifacts of a job are overwritten with an empty implementation.

        This job is only for deploying Gitlab Pages artifacts within the `./public` artifacts path. To create the
        artifacts you have to run jobs, that generate those artifacts within the same `./public` artifacts path,
        before this PagesJob in the pipeline.

        Because the name of the job can't be altered, this job may only exist once in the generated pipeline output.
        Typically you should add the PagesJob to the `gcip.core.pipeline.Pipeline`.

        The PagesJob is also preconfigured with the stage `pages` and the image `alpine:latest`. To change the stage
        of this job, use the `set_stage()` method. Please mention to run this job in a stage after all jobs, that
        fill the `public` artifacts path with content.

        Here a simple example how to use the GitlabPages job:

        ```
        pipeline = Pipeline()
        pipeline.add_children(
            Job(stage="deploy", script="./create-html.sh").add_artifacts_paths("public"),
