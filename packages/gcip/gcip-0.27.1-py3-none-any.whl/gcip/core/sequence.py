"""A Sequence collects multiple `gcip.core.job.Job`s and/or other `gcip.core.sequence.Sequence`s into a group.

This concept is no official representation of a Gitlab CI keyword. But it is such a powerful
extension of the Gitlab CI core funtionality and an essential building block of the gcip, that
it is conained in the `gcip.core` module.

A Sequence offers a mostly similar interface like `gcip.core.job.Job`s that allows to modify
all Jobs and child Sequences contained into that parent Sequence. For example: Instad of calling
`add_tag()` on a dozens of Jobs you can call `add_tag()` on the sequence that contain those Jobs.
The tag will then be applied to all Jobs in that Sequence and recursively to all Jobs within child
Sequenes of that Sequence.

Sequences must be added to a `gcip.core.pipeline.Pipeline`, either directly or as part of other Sequences.
That means Sequences are not meant to be a throw away configuration container for a bunch ob Jobs.
This is because adding a Job to a Sequence creates a copy of that Job, which will be inderectly added to
the `Pipeline` by that Sequence. Not adding that Sequence to a Pipeline means also not adding its Jobs
to the Pipeline. If other parts of the Pipeline have dependencies to those Jobs, they will be broken.

As said before, adding a Job to a Sequence creates copies of that Job. To void conflicts between Jobs,
you should set `name` and/or `stage` when adding the job (or child sequence). The sequence will add
the `name`/`stage` to the ones of the Job, when rendering the pipeline. If you do not set those
identifiers, or you set equal name/stages for jobs and sequences, you provoke having two or more
jobs having the same name in the pipeline. The gcip will raise a ValueError, to avoid unexpected
pipeline behavior. You can read more information in the chapter "Stages allow reuse of jobs
and sequences" of the user documantation.

                are then inherited from parent sequences and not contained in the job itself.

                yaml pipeline this job is contained twice, but with different attributes, he inherits
                from his sequences. If you find and modify this job by the attributes of only one of
                its sequences. Nevertheless when editing the job, the changes will be made on the
                identical job object of both sequences. So you might only want to search and replace
                an attribute of only one resulting job in the final yaml pipeline, but in fact set the
                attributes for both resulting jobs, as you set the attribute on the job and not the
                sequence.
                If you only want to search jobs by attributes the jobs really have, then you have
                to set that flag to `False`. In this case the result may be confusing, because
                you might miss jobs in the result that clearly have attributes you are looking for
                in the final yaml pipeline. This is when those jobs only inherit those attributes
                from their parent pipelines.
                Because of the fact, that you accidentially modify two resulting jobs in the final
                yaml pipeline, by editing the identical job object contained in different sequences,
                the default value of `include_sequence_attributes` is `False`. When you set it to
                `True` you have to consider this fact.
