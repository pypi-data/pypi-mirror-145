    'long_description': '# dbt-dry-run\n\n[dbt][dbt-home] is a tool that helps manage data transformations using templated SQL queries. These SQL queries are \nexecuted against a target data warehouse. It doesn\'t check the validity of SQL queries before it executes your project.\nThis dry runner uses BigQuery\'s [dry run][bq-dry-run] capability to allow you to check that SQL queries are valid before\ntrying to execute them.\n\n## Quickstart\n\n### Installation\n\nThe dry runner can be installed via pip:\n\n`\npip install dbt-dry-run\n`\n\n### Running\n\nThe dry runner has a single command called `dbt-dry-run` in order for it to run you must \nfirst compile a dbt manifest using `dbt compile` as you normally would.\n\nThen on the same machine (So that the dry runner has access to your dbt project source and the \n`manifest.yml`) you can run the dry-runner with:\n\n```\ndbt-dry-run <PROFILE>\n```\n\nBy default it will search for `profiles.yml` in `~/.dbt/` and use the default target specified.\nIt will also look for the `manifest.yml` in the current working directory. \nJust like in the dbt CLI you can override these defaults:\n\n```\npython -m dbt_dry_run default  --profiles-dir /my_org_dbt/profiles/ --target local --manifest-path target/manifest.json\n```\n\n### Reporting Failures\n\nThe dry runner will exit 0 if there are no failures. If there are failures it will exit 1\n\n## Capabilities and Limitations\n\n### Things this can catch\n\nThe dry run can catch anything the BigQuery planner can identify before the query has run. Which \nincludes:\n\n1. Typos in SQL keywords:  `selec` instead of `select`\n2. Typos in columns names: `orders.produts` instead of `orders.products`\n3. Problems with incompatible data types: Trying to execute "4" + 4\n4. Incompatible schema changes to models: Removing a column from a view that is referenced\nby a downstream model explicitly\n5. Incompatible schema changes to sources: Third party modifies schema of source tables without \nyour knowledge\n6. Permission errors: The dry runner should run under the same service account your production \njob runs under. This allows you to catch problems with table/project permissions as dry run queries\nneed table read permissions just like the real query\n   \n### Things this can\'t catch\n\nThere are certain cases where a syntactically valid query can fail due to the data in \nthe tables:\n\n1. Queries that run but do not return intended/correct result. This is checked using [tests][dbt-tests]\n2. `NULL` values in `ARRAY_AGG` (See [IGNORE_NULLS bullet point][bq-ignore-nulls])\n3. Bad query performance that makes it too complex/expensive to run\n\n### Things still to do...\n\nImplementing the dry runner required re-implementing some areas of dbt. Mainly how the \nadapter sets up connections and credentials with the BigQuery client, we have only \nimplemented the methods of how we connect to our warehouse so if you don\'t use OAUTH or \nservice account JSON files then this won\'t be able to read `profiles.yml` correctly.\n\nThe implementation of seeds is incomplete as well as we don\'t use them very much in our \nown dbt projects. The dry runner will just use the datatypes that `agate` infers from the CSV \nfiles.\n\nSnapshots are also not yet supported.\n\n[dbt-home]: https://www.getdbt.com/\n[bq-dry-run]: https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/dry-run-queries\n[dbt-tests]: https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/building-a-dbt-project/tests\n[bq-ignore-nulls]: https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/aggregate_functions#array_agg\n\n## License\n\nCopyright 2022 Auto Trader Limited\n\nLicensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the "License");\nyou may not use this file except in compliance with the License.\nYou may obtain a copy of the License at\n\n   http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0\n\nUnless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, software\ndistributed under the License is distributed on an "AS IS" BASIS,\nWITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.\nSee the License for the specific language governing permissions and\nlimitations under the License.',
