           * - 9
             - Reprocessing (**Reproc**)
             - Calculates emissions, mass flows, and resource use and recovery associated with recycling materials.	 
           * - 10
             - Transfer Station (**TS**)
             - Calculates cost, emissions, and energy use associated with Transfer Stations.
           * - 11
             - Single Family Collection (**SF_Col**)
             - Calculates cost, emissions, and fossil fuel use associated with MSW collection from single family sector.
           * - 12
             - Multi Family Collection (**MF_Col**)
             - Calculates cost, emissions, and fossil fuel use associated with MSW collection from multi-family sector.

             - Calculates cost, emissions, and fossil fuel use associated with MSW collection from commercial sector.
           * - 14
             - Animal Feed (**AnF**)
             - Calculates cost, emissions, and energy use associated with conversion of food waste to animal feed and final use of produced feed.
          
        .. Installation
        
        Installation
        ------------
        1- Download and install miniconda from:  https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html
        
        2- Update conda in a terminal window or anaconda prompt::
        
                conda update conda
        
        3- Create a new environment for swolfpy::
        
                conda create --name swolfpy python=3.7
        
        4- Activate the environment::
        
                conda activate swolfpy
        
        5- Install swolfpy_processmodels in the environment::
        
                pip install swolfpy_processmodels
        
        6- Use in python (e.g., Landfill model)::
        
                import swolfpy_processmodels as sppm 
                model = sppm.LF()
                model.calc()
                LCI_report = model.report()
                LCI_report
