    'long_description': "# django-spinproject\n\nOpinionated version of `django-admin startproject` with some popular third-party packages. Starter pack includes:\n\n* `whitenoise` for painless work with static files;\n* `settings.py` file with `django-environ` support so you can define your databases and stuff with environment variables and `.env` files;\n    * Also, mostly pre-configured (but still optional) app and SQL logging;\n    * Also, `django-postgres-readonly` (in case you have R/O databases);\n    * But otherwise, it's still your standard `settings.py` you used to see in every other project.\n* `script/bootstrap` and other [scripts to rule them all](https://github.blog/2015-06-30-scripts-to-rule-them-all/) so your fellow developers and maintainers don't ask you how to run this thing. Current versions of these scripts optimized for use with [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/), but you can easily adapt them for any Python package manager;\n* A basic `Dockerfile` (and `make` targets for its common usage patterns);\n* `make lint` command for linting with flake8.\n\n## Requirements\n\n* \\*nix system;\n* `django-admin` installed and available from `$PATH`.\n\nGenerated files will work fine in Django >= 2.0, not tested in earlier versions.\n\n## How to use\n\n1. Install the package: `pip install django-spinproject`\n2. `django-spinproject <path>`\n\n## Planned features\n\n(for requests, create an issue or drop me a line at m1kc@yandex.ru)\n\n* Some CLI flags to switch off the things you don't need.\n\n## Changelog\n\n### Jun 21, 2021\n\n* pytest support 'cause you don't want to waste time on setting that up (give it a try: `script/test`);\n* Always call the settings directory `main` 'cause that's the only way to keep people sane when switching projects;\n* Add GitLab CI config generator 'cause you don't want to write one yourself;\n* flake8 isn't expected to be installed on your host system anymore.\n\n### Apr 16, 2021\n\n* `.gitignore` to keep your VCS clean;\n* `.dockerignore` to keep your Docker images clean;\n* `make clean` to get rid of `__pycache__` files when you need that;\n* No need to install `django-postgres-readonly` anymore.\n\n### Feb 5, 2021\n\n* To avoid confusion, `python3` executable is now used instead of `python`.\n\n### Feb 20, 2020\n\n* Makefile now includes an additional target, `lint`, for linting your project with `flake8`. Give it a try: `$ make lint`.\n* Dockerfile now works properly with most recent version of Poetry.\n",
