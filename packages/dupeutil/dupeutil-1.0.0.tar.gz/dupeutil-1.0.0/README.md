## Installation

To install **dupeutil**, enter the following command in your terminal:

```
python -m pip install dupeutil
```

## Usage

**dupeutil** is designed to be as effortless and as easy as possible to use. You can check for duplicate files in a directory by `cd`-ing into that directory and by simply entering the following command in your terminal:

```
dupeutil
```

That's it. The program will then check for duplicate files in the *current working directory* and provide you with a prompt that shows which duplicates were found and ask if you would like to remove them.

Alternatively, if you would like to check a particular directory without it being the current working directory, you can explicitly pass it a directory:

```
dupeutil <path to dir>
```

```
üìù NOTE: You may need to wrap the directory in quotes:

dupeutil "C:\Users\user\Downloads\folder"
```

### Arguments

These are the available command-line arguments that you can pass to **dupeutil**. You can enter `dupeutil -h` or `dupeutil --help` in your terminal to view them as well.

```
positional arguments:
  dir                           the directory to check

options:
  -h, --help                    show this help message and exit
  -f FILES [FILES ...],         the files to compare
  --files FILES [FILES ...]

  -q, --quiet                   suppress output to the console; this option will not ask for
                                permission to  remove files
  -r, --recursive               include files in subdirectories
  -v, --version                 print program version
```

#### Files flag

If you'd rather compare files instead of a directory, you can do so by using the `-f` or `--files` flag:

```
dupeutil -f <path to file1> <path to file2> <path to file3> ... <path to fileN>
```

If any of the paths contain a space, it's recommended that you wrap them in quotes.

#### Quiet flag

If you don't want to see any output in the console, you can pass the `-q` or `--quiet` flag when you run **dupeutil**:

```
dupeutil <path to dir> -q
```

If you include the quiet flag, the program will not provide you with an overview of duplicate files, nor will it ask you for permission to remove those files.

#### Recursive flag

If you would like to include subdirectories in the given directory, pass the `-r` or `--recursive` flag:

```
dupeutil <path to dir> -r
```

Including this flag will cause files in the top-level directory and files in any subdirectories to be compared as well.
