"""
Machinery for defining requirements for tests. Tests are submitted in a
separate file using the `optimism` library, and we can require a certain
number of distinct test cases that target specific functions/files, and
require that all of the checks succeed.

The validation machinery runs the submitted tests file in a directory
with the solution code and checks what test cases it checks and whether
those checks succeed. `rubrics.Rubric.validate_tests` can then be used
to generate a report based on all validation goals; the goals in this
file should normally be used as validation goals, not evaluation goals.

):
    """
    A test harness (to be used with
    `potluck.specifications.test_with_harness`) which will return a
    string reporting on the aggregate behavior of `optimism` tests that
    were defined and checked as a result of running a particular
    function. A minimum number of distinct `optimism` tests cases can be
    required for each of certain target functions, and that those test
    cases must pass all checks applied (this second check can be skipped
    by setting `_must_pass` to `False`).

    If `_must_pass` is set to the string "all", then all tests must
    pass, even if more than the required number of tests are defined,
    otherwise enough tests must pass (i.e., have been checked at least
    once and have succeeded on every check applied) to meet the minimum
    requirements, but cases beyond those are allowed to fail.

    Note that this function has a side effect of deleting all
    previously-defined optimism tests.

    The `_req_cases` argument must be a dictionary mapping function names
    to integers specifying how many distinct tests are required for that
    function. Tests for files can be required by prepending 'file:' to
    the filename to require tests for, and code block tests can be
    required by prepending 'block:' to the exact code block string (but
    that's quite fragile). If `_req_cases` is None (the default) then
    the report will include information on all defined tests.

    As a harness function, most arguments are passed through to whatever
    function is being tested; if that function has arguments named
    `_req_cases` and/or `_must_pass` you'll have to define your own
    custom harness that uses different keyword argument names. Because
    positional arguments are passed through, these two meta-parameters
    must be given as keyword arguments.

    Note that technically, if the solution code has failing test cases,
    when `_must_pass` is set to "all" the reports produced will be the
    same if the submitted code fails the same number of test cases.

    (Note: these docstring paragraphs will be used as the default goal
    description...)
