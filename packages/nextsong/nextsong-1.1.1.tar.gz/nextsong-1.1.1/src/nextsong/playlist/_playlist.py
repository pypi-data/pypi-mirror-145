        of files under the pathlib glob expansion rules.

        Keyword arguments
        -----------------
        shuffle:
            If True, the Playlist will iterate through its children in a
            random order.
        loop:
            If True, the Playlist will loop forever through its
            children.
        portion:
            A number or pair of numbers between 0 and 1. Specifies the
            portion of items in the playlist to be used in a pass of the
            Playlist. For example a portion of 0.2 means only 20% of
            items in the Playlist will be used. If a pair of numbers is
            given, a uniformly random value between the pair of numbers
            will be used. This argument is mutually exclusive with
            count.
        count:
            An integer or pair of integers. Specifies the number of
            items in the playlist to be used in a pass of the Playlist.
            For example a count of 2 means only 2 of items in the
            Playlist will be used. If a pair of numbers is given, a
            uniformly random value between the pair of numbers
            (inclusive) will be used. This argument is mutually
            exclusive with portion.
        recent_portion:
            A number between 0 and 1. This argument can only be used if
            shuffle and loop are both True. By default, a shuffled
            looping Playlist doesn't select items truly independently.
            Items that were recently selected are marked as recent, and
            only non-recent items are candidates for selection. This
            argument specifies the maximum portion of the Playlist that
            can be recent. For example, if recent_portion is 0.2 and the
            Playlist has 10 items, the two most recently selected items
            will not be randomly selected.
        weight:
            A non-negative number indicating the relative likelyhood of
            this Playlist being chosen over its siblings during a random
            sampling. A Playlist with a weight of zero is disabled and
            will never be selected.
