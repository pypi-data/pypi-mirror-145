  Design a digital finit impulse response (FIR) filter using the scipy method 
  scipy.signal.firls. 

  The description of scipy.signal.firls arguments is taken from scipy documentation.

  :param numtaps: The number of taps in the FIR filter. numtaps must be odd.
  :type: int

  :param bands: A monotonic nondecreasing sequence containing the band edges in Hz. 
  All elements must be non-negative and less than or equal to the Nyquist 
  frequency given by nyq.
  :type bands: array-like

  :param desired: A sequence the same size as bands containing the desired gain at 
  the start and end point of each band.
  :type desired: array-like.

  :param fs: The sampling frequency of the signal. Each frequency in bands must be between 
  0 and fs/2 (inclusive). Default is 2.

  :param plot_response: Set to True to plot the frequency transfer function of the filter. 
  Default False.
  :type plot_response: bool

  :return: filter that will be used to convolve the signal.

  .. note :: By default, the designed filter is a high pass filter with a cut frequency at 800 muHz. 
  The sampling considered is 20 seconds, which corresponds to a Nyquist frequency at 25 mHz.
  If you want to set the cut frequency at, for example, 100 muHz, with another Nyquist frequency value, 
  try passing the following arguments to the function :
  >>> bands = [0, 90e-6, 90e-6, 100e-6, 100e-6, f_nyquist] 
  >>> desired = [0,0,0,1,1,1]
  >>> fs = 2 * f_nyquist
