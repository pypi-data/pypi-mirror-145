apollinaire
=======================================

**apollinaire** is a Python implementation of helio- and asteroseismic MCMC
peakbagging methods. You will find here all the necessary tools in order to
analyse the acoustic oscillations of your favourite solar-like star. 

The source code is hosted on a `GitLab repository
<https://gitlab.com/sybreton/apollinaire>`_ and is still in development.  To
find more details on the power spectrum modelling framework used by
**apollinaire**, you can consult `Breton et al. (2022, submitted)
<https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.07524>`_.
