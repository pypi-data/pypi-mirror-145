Yellowbox makes it easy to run docker containers as part of black box tests.

**Documentation:** https://yellowbox.readthedocs.io/

---
## Examples
Say you want to run a blackbox test on a service that depends on a redis server.

```python
from yellowbox.clients import docker_client
from yellowbox.extras import RedisService


def test_black_box():
  with docker_client() as docker_client, RedisService.run(docker_client) as redis:
    redis_port = redis.client_port()  # this the host port the redis
    ...  # run your black box test here
  # yellowbox will automatically close the service when exiting the scope


def test_black_box_with_initial_data():
  # you can use the service's built-in utility functions to
  # easily interoperate the service
  with docker_client() as docker_client,
          RedisService.run(docker_client) as redis,
          redis.client() as client:
    client.set("foo", "bar")
  ...
```
## Supported Extras
The currently supported built-in services are:
* Kafka: `from yellowbox.extras import KafkaService`
    * currently, the kafka service supports only plaintext protocol, and always binds to the host port 9092
* Logstash: `from yellowbox.extras import LogstashService`
* RabbitMQ: `from yellowbox.extras import RabbitMQService`
* Redis: `from yellowbox.extras import RedisService`

Note: all these extras require additional dependencies as specified in the project's `extras`.
## Networks
Yellowbox also makes it easy to set up temporary docker networks, so that different containers and services can
communicate directly.

```python
from yellowbox.clients import docker_client
from yellowbox import temp_network, connect
from yellowbox.extras import RabbitMQService


def test_network():
  with docker_client() as docker_client,
          RabbitMQService.run(docker_client) as rabbit,
          temp_network(docker_client) as network,
          connect(network, rabbit) as alias:
    # yellow's "connect" function connects between a network and a
    # Container/YellowService, retrieves the container's alias(es) on 
    # the network, and disconnects the two when done
    another_container = docker_client.containers.create("my-image",
                                                        environment={"RABBITMQ_HOSTNAME": alias[0]}
                                                        )
    with connect(network, another_container):
      another_container.start()
      another_container.wait()
```
## As Pytest Fixtures
Both yellow services and networks can be used fluently with `pytest` fixures

```python
from yellowbox.clients import docker_client
from pytest import fixture

from yellowbox.extras import RedisService


@fixture
def docker_client():
  with docker_client() as ret:
    yield ret


@fixture
def redis_service(docker_client):
  with RedisService.run(docker_client) as service:
    yield service


def black_box(redis_service):
  # run your test with the redis service provided
  ...
```
since docker container may take some time to set up, it's advisable to set their scope to at least `"module"`

---
## Extending Yellow
Users can create their own Yellow Service classes by implementing the `YellowService` abstract class.
If the service encapsulates only a single container, the `SingleContainerService` class already implements
the necessary methods.
