Description: Project pyfromroot
        ==================
        
        *initial setup*
        
        The goal is to have a framework to run Python from root\'s CLINT. Why?
        
        -   TH1F and TGraph on TCanvas is superior over python stuff
        -   and it is interactive
        -   staying in root allows to have a access to histograms and all other
            stuff
