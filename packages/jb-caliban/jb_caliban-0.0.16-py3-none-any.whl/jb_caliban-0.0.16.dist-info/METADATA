caliban: Calcium Imaging and Behavior Analysis
=======
>...in dreaming,  
The clouds methought would open, and show riches  
Ready to drop upon me; that, when I waked,   
I cried to dream again.

*The Tempest*, Act III, Scene ii

Twinkling calcium imaging videos are certainly filled with riches. Whereas Caliban is showered with riches in his slumber, we must dig a little harder to mine these datasets. This software was developed to assist fellow wayward travelers on their journey to understanding how neurons encode information.


# <img src="readme_pic.jpg">



This code base was written with the intention of serving as a toolbox for:

1. Statistical Testing of neuron classification by behavior.
2. Visualization of neural activity and behavior data
3. Graph Theoretical Analysis of networks of neurons.
4. Data Visualization tool -- see the "full picture" of the data garnered from experiments with integration of calcium imaging movies, behavioral videos, and data processing results.
5. processing behavior data with Google Colab notebooks
