    Warning:
        Memory passing is not supported in this version of Orchest, this

    Note:
        Calling :meth:`output_to_memory` multiple times within the same
        script will overwrite the output, even when using a different
        output ``name``. You therefore want to be only calling the

    To manage outputing the data to memory for the user, this function
    uses metadata to add info to objects inside the plasma store.

    Args:
        data: Data to output.
        name: Name of the output data. As a string, it becomes the name
            of the data, when ``None``, the data is considered nameless.

            :func:`get_inputs`.

    Raises:
        DataInvalidNameError: The name of the output data is invalid,

            it contains a reserved substring.

            ``disk_fallback=False``.
        OrchestNetworkError: Could not connect to the
            ``Config.STORE_SOCKET_NAME``, because it does not exist.
            Which might be because the specified value was wrong or the

    Note:
        Calling :meth:`output` multiple times within the same step

    Args:
        data: Data to output.
        name: Name of the output data. As a string, it becomes the name

        DataInvalidNameError: The name of the output data is invalid,
