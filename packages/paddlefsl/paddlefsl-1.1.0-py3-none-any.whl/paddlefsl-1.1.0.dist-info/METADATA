# PaddleFSL

PaddleFSL is a Python library for few-shot learning (FSL) built upon PaddlePaddle 2.0.
- Provide various 
FSL solutions which are applicable to diverse applications. 
- Contain detailed 
annotations and tutorial examples, such that users can easily develop and compare different FSL solutions. 
- Can be easily deployed on various training platforms.

## Overview

- **paddlefsl**: The proposed package for FSL.
  - **paddlefsl.backbones**: It provides representation learning models to extract sample representation, such as CNN, GNN and PLM.
  - **paddlefsl.datasets**: It provides publicly accessible benchmark few-shot datasets of diverse application scenarios, such as Omniglot, FewRel, FewGLUE and Tox21.
  - **paddlefsl.model_zoo**: It provides classical FSL models which particularly deal with the lack of labeled data, such as ProtoNet, MAML and PET.
  - **paddlefsl.task_sampler**: It provides APIs to split datasets into the typical N-way K-shot tasks.
  - **paddlefsl.utils**: It provides auxiliary APIs of PaddleFSL. 
- **examples**: It provides examples of applying PaddleFSL to diverse application scenarios, such as computer vision tasks, natural language tasks and bioinformatics tasks.
- **raw_data**: It provides guides to download and place the raw data files.
- **test**: It provides unit test files of functions and classes.


## Installation

To use our package, users should first install paddlepaddle-v2.0.0 or later versions, see https://www.paddlepaddle.org.cn/install .

First, install our required packages.

```bash
# Clone our repository.
git clone https://github.com/tata1661/FSL-Mate.git
# Install requirements.
cd FSL-Mate/PaddleFSL
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Second, update environment variables.

```bash
# Please edit env.sh to set the correct path of FSL-paddletoolkit directory.
# Then do:
source env.sh
# If you want to use our package frequently, you can add environment variables into .bashrc
cat env.sh >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
```

Finally, check whether the installation is successful.

```bash
# Start a python interpreter
python
>>> import paddlefsl
>>> paddlefsl.__version__
'1.1.0'
```
