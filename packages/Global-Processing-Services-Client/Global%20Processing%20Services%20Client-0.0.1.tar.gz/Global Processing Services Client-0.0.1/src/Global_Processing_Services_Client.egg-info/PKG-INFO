# Client library for Global Processing Services

ðŸš§ WARNING: This repository is experimental at this stage and should be used
with caution ðŸš§

Only a handful of methods are implemented at this stage.

# Installation

```
$ pip install globalprocessing-client
```

# Getting started

The first thing you need to do is initialise the client:

```
from globalprocessing_client import GPSClient

client = GPSClient(
    "username",
    "password",
    "iss_code",
    "https://wsdl.globalprocessing.com/",
    "Australia/Sydney"
)
```

Once you have a client up and running, you can run the various commands

## Create Card

To create a new card, simply call `create_card` on the newly initiated client:

```
card_design_id = 123
client.create_card(card_design_id)
```

If you want to change any of the default arguments, just pass in a dictionary with the changes
as the second argument:

```
card_design_id = 123
default_overrides = {
    "WSID": "A different ID",
    "LoadValue": 10.0,
}
client.create_card(card_design_id, default_overrides)
```

## Update Status

Update Status works much the same as Create Card:

```
card_public_token = "public token"

client.status_change(
    card_public_token,
    GPSClient.ACCOUNT_CLOSED,
)
```

To override default, pass a dictionary as the third argument:

```
card_public_token = "public token"

client.status_change(
    card_public_token,
    GPSClient.ACCOUNT_CLOSED,
    {
        "WSID": "something unique",
        "ItemSrc": "test",
    },
)
```

### Status codes

The available status codes are available as constants on the `GPSClient` class:

- OK = "00"
- NOT_ACTIVATED = "02"
- CAPTURE_CARD = "04"
- DO_NOT_HONOUR = "05"
- LOST_CARD = "41"
- STOLEN_CARD = "43"

- TRANSACTION_NOT_PERMITTED_TO_CARDHOLDER = "57"
- SUSPECTED_FRAUD = "59"
- RESTRICTED_CARD = "62"
- SECURITY_VIOLATION = "63"
- CARDHOLDER_CONTACT_ISSUER = "70"
- ALLOWABLE_NUMBER_OF_PIN_TRIED_EXCEEDED = "75"
- CARD_DESTROYED = "83"
- REFUND_GIVEN_TO_CUSTOMER = "98"
- CARD_VOIDED = "99"
- SHORT_TERM_BLOCK = "G1"
- SHORT_TERM_FULL_BLOCK = "G2"
- LONG_TERM_BLOCK = "G3"
- LONG_TERM_FULL_BLOCK = "G4"
